            <strong style="font-size: 30px;">Myers–Briggs Type Indicator</strong>
            <br>
            The rise of social media as a platform for self-expression and self-understanding has led to increased
            interest in using the Myers–Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) to explore human personalities. Despite this,
            there needs to be more research on how other word- embedding techniques, machine learning
            algorithms, and imbalanced data-handling techniques can improve the results of MBTI personality-type
            predictions. Our research aimed to investigate the efficacy of these techniques by utilizing the
            Word2Vec model to obtain a vector representation of words in the corpus data. We implemented
            several machine learning approaches, including logistic regression, linear support vector classification,
            stochastic gradient descent, random forest, the extreme gradient boosting classifier, and the cat
            boosting classifier. In addition, we used the synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) to
            address the issue of imbalanced data. The results showed that our approach could achieve a relatively
            high F1 score (between 0.7383 and 0.8282), depending on the chosen model for predicting and
            classifying MBTI personality. Furthermore, we found that using SMOTE could improve the selected
            models’ performance (F1 score between 0.7553 and 0.8337), proving that the machine learning
            approach integrated with Word2Vec and SMOTE could predict and classify MBTI personality well,
            thus enhancing the understanding of MBTI. <br> <br>

            <strong style="font-size: 25px;">The MBTI is based on four dichotomies:</strong> 
            <br><br>
            <strong>1. Extraversion (E) vs. Introversion (I):</strong>  This dichotomy reflects how individuals direct
            their energy. Extraverts are energized by interacting with others and the external world,
            while introverts are energized by spending time alone and focusing on their inner
            thoughts and feelings. <br> <br>
            <strong>2. Sensing (S) vs. Intuition (N):</strong> This dichotomy represents how individuals gather
            information. Sensors rely on their five senses and are more focused on concrete details
            and practical realities, while Intuitives are more focused on patterns, possibilities, and
            abstract concepts. <br><br>
            <strong>3. Thinking (T) vs. Feeling (F):</strong> This dichotomy reflects how individuals make decisions.
            Thinkers tend to make decisions based on logic and objective analysis, while Feelers
            make decisions based on their values, emotions, and the impact on others. <br><br>
            <strong>4. Judging (J) vs. Perceiving (P):</strong> This dichotomy represents how individuals approach
            the outside world. Judgers prefer structure, organization, and planning, while Perceivers
            prefer flexibility, spontaneity, and adaptability. <br><br>

                With a compelling drive to understand how and why things work, ISTPs are action-oriented doers focused on the present. They are practical, realistic, and possess an excellent ability to apply logic and reason. They are masters of tools from the microscopic drill to the supersonic jet, and they are happiest in careers that allow them to use technical skills and tools to problem solve, troubleshoot, or manage a crisis. As leaders, ISTPs are usually up-front leading the charge.
